## Assignment B4: Option A â€“ Strings and functional programming in R

Weclome to the final STAT 545 Assignment. I elected for option A for my final project.

### Exercise 1: Text Analysis (Dissecting Frankestein)
In the first exercise, we take a closer look at the freuquency of the most common words in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to get a better idea of the important themes and focus of the book. 
For this analysis, we utilize the tidyverse, the map() functions from the purrr package, some regular expressions, and common stopwords from the stopwords package to filter out articles and common stopwords and mine the text for the critical thematic words.

### Exercise 3: 
For exercise 3, I looked at data from my own research to run multiple linear models across the different levels of a group. 
In my thesis data, I am interested in the relationship between 8 groups of my response variable and one explanatory variable. Data was collected periodically throughout the dry season, and each obs_period group represents data collected later in the dry season. Rather than run each relationship as a separate model, I will use the "map" family of functions in the purrr package to apply a linear model to multiple columns simultaneously.
